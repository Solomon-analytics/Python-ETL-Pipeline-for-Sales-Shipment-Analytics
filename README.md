**Sales Orders & Shipment Data Warehouse (Python)**
This project showcase how to build an end-to-end data warehouse and reporting solution for sales orders and shipment data and solves real world business problem of making data available for data analysis and reporting consumption.

---
## Key Features

- Data Extraction & ETL: Used Python (Pandas + SQLAlchemy) to extract raw sales, customer, and shipment data from multiple CSV/SQL sources.

- Data Transformation: Cleaned and transformed datasets (handling duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent formats).

- Data Modelling: Designed a star schema for orders, shipments, customers, and products, supporting scalable analytics.

- Automation: Built Python scripts to automate ETL workflows, reducing manual processing.

- Analytics & Reporting: Developed SQL stored procedures and Power BI dashboards to track KPIs such as order volume, on-time delivery, and customer performance.

**Outcomes**:

Automated recurring analysis of orders and shipments, reducing reporting time.

Delivered interactive dashboards that provide actionable insights into sales trends, shipment delays, and customer behaviour.

Enabled business users to identify bottlenecks and optimise supply chain efficiency.

ðŸ‘‰ This way, recruiters/technical reviewers who land on your GitHub see: problem â†’ tools â†’ value delivered.

Do you want me to also rewrite your other GitHub project descriptions (like Customer Churn, Supply Chain, etc.) so they all follow this clear, business-value format?
